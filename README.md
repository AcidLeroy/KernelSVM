#SVMs with Kernels

To build the document here are the steps that you need to take: 

- If the symlink is not already created, create a symlink to the tex file like so: 
`ln -s hw2.tex hw2.m`. You may have to delete the original hw2.m file. 
- Once you have done that, you need to run the hw2.m matlab script. If it complains
about missing directories, you might have to create those by hand. 
- Once you have run the script, you are ready to compile the .tex file using latex.
